          <p>
            Life was running full throttle when it skidded to a halt at the Corona Milestone. With OPDs closed, OTs closed for routine surgeries, due to the pandemic lock up, I metamorphosed from a full time doctor and a part time writer, to a full-fledged writer and a part time doctor. <br><br>
      
      What amazed me was the sudden change of heart of the public towards doctors. Overnight we became ‘Corona Warriors’, ‘Front Liners’, ‘Soldiers in White’, for risking our lives to save theirs. I was not taken in by this sudden change of heart, or the nationwide clapping for us. <br><br>
      
      Sure enough, sooner rather than later, a senior doctor was dragged into the streets, stripped and beaten for complaining that they were not being given N95 masks, leave alone PPE kits to protect themselves against the virus! How was the infantry expected to fight the enemy armed merely with batons? Where was the ammunition, the protective gear? When saviours became victims while serving the sick, they were asked to pay for the hotel rooms they were shifted to for quarantine! <br>
      
      
      <img style="margin: 30px;" src="https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1222710431.jpg" alt="">
      
      Demoralised by the futility of their sacrifices, surrounded by death and decay, they toiled on without pay, precariously holding on to their sanity. After having worked for days in constricting kits and suffocating masks, on the verge of dehydration due to excessive sweating, they looked forward to their hard earned offs. Once released from the double prison of hospital wards and PPE kits, they rushed homewards to their waiting families, for doctors are offspring, parents and spouses too. <br><br>
      
      To their horror they were shunned as lepers and barred entry into their colony gates for off duty, they were a hazard to society! For once, the medical fraternity in a Ghaziabad colony united and sent a memorandum to the RWA that the doctors practising locally too, would not see the colony patients and they had better seek medical advice elsewhere!
      <br><br>
      The doctor within slowly suffocated to death. Without much resistance I succumbed to the pressure of my family and gave up practice for the time being, for I was a senior citizen with diabetes and hypertension. Though I had tamed these twin terrors for years, they now appeared restless; sensing a strong ally in corona, with whose help they could overthrow me for, age was another factor that worked against me. As I had still retained the enthusiasm and vigour of youth, as the sap of life still surged in abundance, I had thought that, age mattered only if you were ‘cheese, wine or Scotch’. But now I knew better.
      <br><br>
      For a while the enforced holiday was a dream come true. I could sleep when I wanted, for as long as I wanted, sure in the knowledge that there would be no night calls, no early morning surgeries, no threats of court cases, no fear of violence by belligerent patients. I began to binge watch movies, binge eat foods that were not good for me and binge read books that I had meant to read when I got the time.
      <br><br>
      The novelty soon wore off and a life of dissipation began to pall. One who slept soundly after long working hours, began to have troubled and disturbed sleep. The stomach of a disciplined eater began to revolt against foods it could not stomach. I began to miss the OPD hustle bustle, the thrill of the OT, even the corporate politics I had so detested. I suffered from withdrawal symptoms, besides the monetary pinch.
      <br><br>
      Once I was earning a handsome sum and had a contingency plan in place – a rental income that would stand me in good stead once my working days were over. With one stroke both were severed at source and from now on I would have to draw upon my savings for sustenance. If this was my state, what of migrant labour that had no means to live or leave?
      <br><br>
      I realised it was not only lives that corona took. What measure did we have to account for the terror that throttled peace of mind, the loneliness of individual isolation, or the chafing of relationships due to the constant proximity – domestic violence has doubled during the lock-in period – and a gasping economy that experts are trying to revive?
